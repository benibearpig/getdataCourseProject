Getdata 010 Course Project

The run_analysis.R assumes it's working in the directory containing test/train data sets. It works like this:
* Extract features.txt only for features of "mean" or "std" types.
* Combine test/train data sets
* Aggregate on the feature variables on the subjects

Usage: simply run the script in the same data directory.
